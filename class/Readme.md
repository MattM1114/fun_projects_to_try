Lesson One: Python Basics
Welcome to our introductory lesson on Python! Today we'll be covering the basics of Python programming, including variables, functions, comments, while loops, and for loops.

Comments
Let's start with comments. Comments in Python are used to explain the code or to provide information to other programmers who might be working with your code. There are two ways to write comments in Python:

Single-line comments start with the # character and extend to the end of the line. Multi-line comments are enclosed in triple quotes (""" or ''') and can span multiple lines.

Variables
Variables are used to store values in Python. To declare a variable, you simply give it a name and assign it a value. Here are some examples


Python has many other data types that can be stored in variables, including lists, tuples, and sets. Here are some examples:

Functions
Functions are blocks of code that can be reused throughout a program. They are defined using the def keyword and can take arguments as input. Here's an example:

In the that example, we defined a function called add_numbers that takes two arguments (x and y) and returns their sum. We can call this function anywhere in our program like this:

While Loops
While loops are used to repeatedly execute a block of code while a certain condition is true. Here's the basic syntax:

Here's an example of a while loop that counts from 1 to 5:

In the this example, we first set the variable count to 1. Then we enter the while loop, which will continue to execute as long as count is less than or equal to 5. Inside the loop, we print the value of count and then increment it by 1.

For Loops
For loops are used to iterate over a sequence of items, such as a list or a tuple. Here's the basic syntax:

Here's an example of a for loop that prints each item in a list:

In this  example, we define a list called fruits and then loop through each item in the list using a for loop. Inside the loop, we print the value of fruit.

Here are a few questions related to the lesson:

Q: What is a variable in Python?
A: A variable is a named container that stores a value or a reference to a value in Python. Variables can hold different types of data, including integers, floats, strings, booleans, lists, tuples, sets, and dictionaries.

Q: What is the difference between a mutable and immutable data type in Python?
A: Mutable data types in Python, such as lists and dictionaries, can be modified after they are created, while immutable data types, such as tuples, strings, and integers, cannot be modified after they are created.

Q: What is a function in Python?
A: A function is a block of code that performs a specific task and can be called or invoked by other parts of the program. Functions help to modularize code and make it more readable and easier to maintain.

Q: What is a loop in Python?
A: A loop is a programming construct that allows you to repeat a set of instructions multiple times. Python supports two types of loops: the while loop and the for loop. The while loop repeats a set of instructions as long as a certain condition is true, while the for loop iterates over a sequence of elements and executes a block of code for each element.

Q: What is a comment in Python?
A: A comment in Python is a piece of text that is ignored by the Python interpreter and is used to document the code and explain what it does. Comments can be single-line or multi-line and are denoted by the hash (#) symbol or triple quotes, respectively.
