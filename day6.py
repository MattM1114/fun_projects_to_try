# to create a function you would do this
def my_function():
    print("hello")
    print("world")

# every thing indited just bellow the function are a apart of that
# function like how things have to be indited for loops
# I use spaces to indent but using the tab key
# this is a while loop


hey = 0
# this loop will call my_function 7 times and add 1 to hey till it == 7

while hey < 7:
    my_function()
    hey += 1

# this is a good place to learn and revise these concepts here you will control a little robot and get him to do certain tasks or reach a goal
# for loops are great at iteration and while loops are best to do something over and over again be care full with these you might create an infante loop
# you can also practice using scratch
# or you can play rabbids coding
